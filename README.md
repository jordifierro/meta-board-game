## Set of components

MBG is composed by tiles, tokens and dice.

#### Tiles

* The tiles are separated in 4 squares on each side,
two of them dark and two of them light,
each disposed diagonally from its pair (like chess board).
* In one side of the tile there is a neutral color,
and on the other there is an specific color.
* There are 9 different colors:
black, white, gold, silver, brown, red, blue, green and violet.
* Each color has 4 tiles,
so there are a total of 36 tiles
(can form a 6x6 board,
which can also be a 24x24 if you count the tiles inner squares).

#### Tokens

* There are 4 types of tokens:
cubes, cylinders, tetrahedron (triangular-based pyramid) and pawns.
* Tetrahedron tokens have two faces forming an angle of 90 between them
(they are like an squared pyramid diagonally split).
* There are 10 tokens of each type for each color,
except for the pawn that has only one for color.

#### Dice

* 10 dice of six faces.
